*"How should one act in a given situation"*
### Formalism of Utilitarianism
- **Definition:** *"Actions are right in the proportion as they promote happiness; wrong as they produce the reverse of happiness"* 
- Determine one's actions on the basis of their consequence
- One possible utilitarian action: Caring about the vulnerable and not the masses
### Happiness
- **Happiness:** intended pleasure and absence of pain
- **Unhappiness:** pain and privation of pleasure
- Why Happiness provides pleasure: no reason could be given and is treated as an axiom

### Preemptive Rebuttals
##### Utilitarianism is Crude

Predicted Rebuttal 
- Pleasure should not be the "directive rule of human conduct"
- low standard to measure goodness of human action

Preemptive Response
- One might derive pleasures from different activities at a point of time, few of them being literature, morals, culture, theatre, music, friendship, movies, mathematics, philosophy and activism. Due to these faculties which are more elevated than animal appetites, humans should not fall into the trap of immediate bodily pleasures.
- These higher pleasures which are associated to knowledge, feelings and morality are often more desirable and valuable then most of the bodily pleasures.
- Moral obligation is not require: A person who is competently acquainted with both the actions, might prefer an action which is not morally superior to other if he thinks that task is far above the other. Hence decision making is more merely based on morals, but also based on the joy derived out of it.
- *Those who are equally acquainted and equally capable of appreciating and enjoying both high are low pleasured give a marked preference to the manner of existence which employs their higher facilities.*
- The conditions of being acquainted to both the pleasures and being able to capably take the decision are equally important. Experiencing only one pleasure is not enough to be a good decision maker on which one is the best.

- *better to be a human dissatisfied then being a pig satisfied.*
- education that enhances the capacity to experience the higher pleasures
- education about anything -> availability of more avenues of pleasure
- Genuine education:
	- more than mastery of technical skills or absorption of information
	- development of intellectual capacities whose exercise can lead to life long source of pleasure

##### Utilitarianism is selfish
- It has an egalitarian foundation.
- Happiness referred in Utilitarianism is not the agent's own happiness but the greatest amount of happiness altogether. The definitions of the same could likely be happiness for the masses, more happiness for the vulnerable sections or anything else but is not restricted to just oneself.
- While making a decision, the agent must be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator.

Rebuttals:
- Not realistic, people are selfish and prioritise their own incentives above the happiness of others.

Response:
- True, but this predicament can change
- importance of education emphasised upon for alteration of this selfish behaviour and incorporation of a more egalitarian perspective to life
##### If not selfish, it becomes "Moral Fanaticism", ie obsessive enthusiasm

Predicted Rebuttal:
- The idea implies that one should work all the time for the benefit of others, and their personal endeavours must be secondary.

Preemptive Responses:
- Most of the time it is fine to function via non-moral considerations. Most of the times, the weight of happiness of a consequence which might attain a personal incentive might be greater than the pleasure of a moral obligation.

##### Utilitarianism is Frigid, ie it shows no emotions

Predicted Rebuttal:
- This process might turn humans into moral-calculating machines
- Risk of turning the practitioners cold and extremist

Preemptive Responses:
- severity of moral calculation is still better than fuzzy sentimentalism
- accepts the downsides highlighted in the rebuttals but still weighs his theory to be better on the metric of better lives 

##### Utilitarianism is Expedient, ie it is convenient for a purpose but possible not completely honest or moral in all situations
