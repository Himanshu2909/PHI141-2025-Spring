### Preemptive Rebuttals
##### Pleasure should not be the "directive rule of human conduct"
##### Utilitarianism is selfish
##### If not selfish, it becomes "Moral Fanaticism", ie obsessive enthusiasm

##### Utilitarianism is Frigid, ie it shows no emotions

##### Utilitarianism is Expedient, ie it is convenient for a purpose but possible not completely honest or moral in all situations
