# Kant on Metaphysics of Morals

Kant:
1. Rejects happiness as the ultimate standard of moral judgement
2. Denies we can determine whether an action is right or wrong by calculating it's consequences

### Good Will
- Only good will has unconditional worth
- A good will not not good because of the objectives it accomplishes or how it impacts anyone else; it is good simply because it is good in and of itself.
- Utility derived from an action is a function of various other external events, your personal incentives, and your ability to carry out that action. These are not controlled by you so they are not the true measure of your moral worth of an action. That is why, your intent behind doing something is the only metric which matters.
- An action done has its moral worth not in the purpose that is accomplished form it, but the underlying **maxim** by which it was determined. Hence the moral does not depend on the realization of the object of action, but merely on the principle of volition according to which the action was done.

### Duty
- Good will can be reformulated as simply having the "duty" to do something.
- There are 4 ways in which an action can relate to duty:
	1. Acting contrary to the duty
	2. Acting in accord to the duty  but not really wanting to: Having an immediate inclination to follow the duty is also important for an act to be considered as moral. If you don't have the interest to follow the duty but external situations line with your incentive to follow the duty, you do not do the  duty out of your good will or morality, but out of your personal incentive.  
	3. Acting according to duty and really wanting to: The "want" to align with the duty comes from a secondary incentive like "societal acceptance", "karma", etc
	4. Acting according to and from duty: Even though you suffer because of your decision, the ONLY reason to follow that decision is because you think it is your duty to follow that morally right duty.

### Universality
- A moral imperative should be universal, ie should apply to everyone.
- During evaluation, we more than often step out from our perspective and scrutinize the action from a perspective that tries to encompass everyone.
- Categorical Imperative: I should never act except in such a way that I can also will that my maxim should become a universal law.
- If an action breaks the universality of a particular duty or law, that action is morally bad
- If an a action, when implemented on a universal level or when seen from a universal perspective contradict the core principle duty itself, that action is morally bad.
- If a maxim destroys itself as soon as it becomes a universal law, that maxim is not a "moral good".
- Consequences are liable to accidental twists; but morality requires one to take responsibility of their action.


### Egalitarianism
- Kant believes that utilitarian basis of egalitarianism is weak, because when the oppression of people is done in isolation, it does not impact you or the society as a whole.
- You must treat humanity the way you want yourself to be treated
- One must not treat others "simply" as a means to an end, because this "simply means" transforms one into an object which comes to one's disposal, breaking the point of humanity.
- One must treat others with respect and even if they treat others as means to an end, they should not treat them as "just" a means to an end (as that violates their humanity)

### v/s Mill's  utilitarianism
- Kant's Metaphysics of Morals is simple - requires no calculations, weighting, justifications and rationalizations
- It is impossible for one to ever be certain of their actual motivations. It is impossible to completely understand the depths of "secret incentives" of an individual; so something which might look like "good will" and a "response to one's duty", might simply be a person acting on their secret internal incentives.
