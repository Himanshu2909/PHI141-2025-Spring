Socrates was put on trial for public contempt, because people claimed his ideas against the existence of god and philosophical thinking so called "corrupted kids". 

### Pursuit to determine the wisest

3 classes of people selected:
1. **Politicians:**
	- They need to take quick decisions which are consequential for a huge number of people, and they need to make these decisions quick enough and can't wait for a long period of time because they are time sensitive
	- Extremely confident about their decisions
2. **Poets:**
	- Their poems, stories, art etc forms the basis of culture of the society
	- What people wear, do, sing, and how the society behaves is dictated by their writings
3. **Technicians:**
	- They have in depth knowledge about whatever they are doing
	- They are specialised in their subject matter

But he found the following issues:
1. Politicians:
	- Are not open to questions
	- Are not open to new ideas, and changing their ideologies
	- Always in a hurry, so are not able to self reflect
2. Poets:
	- Not really aware of the reasons behind what they are creating and producing
	- Abstract: hence can't explain their own artwork
3. Technicians:
	- Not skilled and knowledgeable about domains other than their specialisations, because they dive deep into what they are experts in 
	- Think that they are also specialists in other domains and have knowledge about that, but in reality it is false.
	- They overreach

Conclusion: Neither Socrates, nor the other people know anything worthwhile about this world, are are not really wise, but Socrates is self aware of his pitfalls and is aware that he's not wise. This acceptance makes him the wisest because at least, unlike the other people he does not overreach to claim or pretend that he is aware of things.

### Human Wisdom


### Socratic Method
- ask questions when you are aware of your limitations
- unexamined life is not worth living for men
- self examination leads to philosophical conversation
- To gain knowledge, one must locate themselves between knowledge and ignorance

##### How do use the socratic method? 
How to question -> use Socrates as the "model" of philosophical life and watch him as he converses with others and as relentlessly he examines their assertions and believes

##### Examples
1. **Euthyphro**: religious young man who is deeply convinced of his own **piety** 
	- What is piety?
	- God Love someone who is pious because he is a pious or is someone pious because gods love him  
2. **Meletus**: man who has charged Socrates with subversion/"corrupting the youth"

##### Method
- think backwards towards fundamental presuppositions
- articulate, and defend both your presuppositions and consequences, and do so without any consequences
