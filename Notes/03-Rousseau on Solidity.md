- Analyses the **Pre-Social Condition**, which he calls the **State of Nature**
- Tries to determine the externalities, ie the things which are not natural to one-self and tries to eliminate them in order to carve a picture of the Pre-Social Condition
- Explains the transition from the this State of Nature to the Social Condition, compares and contrasts

Aim: To prove whether inequalities (social, economic, political) are natural, or human made
#### The State of Nature
- Tough to detach what a human derives from the society, and what comes naturally to them. Hence, construct a thought experiment when a "savage man" used to live alone.
- "extraneous matter"
- people mistake the most familiar things to be natural
- Expectation of future events is absent, and focus on the present
- MOST OF THE ILLS ARE OF OUR OWN MAKING
	- Risk of living in a society with technological advancements: Electronics
	- Advancements in Medicine
	- Relationships
- pity

#### Society
- **Faculty of self perfection**
	- Difference b/w savage and animals: freedom, ie they can deviate from instincts. This is claimed to be problematic
	- Problem with the argument: 
		- capacity for self perfection requires some ability to imagine a better future (which was eliminated from the state of nature)
		- this "problem" allowed humans to survive the unexpected changes in a situation of the forest, hence allowing for survival 
- Explained how "unexpected changes", and "random chances" lead to evolution in a form which lead to societies and civilisations 
- Civilisations -> culture, dance, music etc -> judgemental attitude
- "**egocentricism**" v/s "**love for oneself**"
	- "love for oneself" existed in the State of Nature, which lead from the desire to preserve oneself. It coexists with pity, which leads to humanity
	- "egocentricism": 
		- Rousseau's rewriting of **biblical fall**
		- born in society
		- artificial
		- inspires each individual to value himself more than anyone else
		- does not exist in the state of nature, as every human only observes and perceives himself, rather than constantly comparing and contrasting oneself with others
- In society, we see ourselves through the eyes of others.
- One's perception and appearance started to matter
- Being something and appearing to be something are two completely different things
- This gave rise to hypocrisy, cunning, deception
