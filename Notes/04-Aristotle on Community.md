### Important ideas of Rousseau
1. One must study the "natural" or "robust" state of things, not the state which is artificially induced or nurtured. 
	1. For Rousseau, this is investigating man at a point of time artificial objects and concepts like technology hadn't weakened him, and society ruined him.
2. One must start from the origins to realise what is natural, because observation of one's surroundings might lead to bias which arises from how one is conditioned to view the status quo as the natural state.
3. The current state of mankind being a game of chance, wherein a lot of events like fire, gatherings, formation of society happened not because some logical causality,  but just because of a small event with low chance (In line with ideas of evolution, as propagated by Darwin).
4. Inequalities are a result of social interactions

### Basis of the Ideology
- Aristotle is focused on what is around him, and considers that to be the "naturally evolved" state of humans (why so? more on this in **Teleology**)
- **Humans are purposive**: they do things to achieve a purpose, and they do it because they think whatever they are doing will lead to something good

### Community
#### Communities operate purposively
- families of masters and corresponding slaves make households, collection of households make a village, collection of villages make a city.
- Political community is natural, as it is the status quo, and what we see around ourselves
	- **Rousseau Disagrees**
		- One's logical and familiar sensibility is socially constructed
		- One starts projecting this socially constructed sensibility onto the screen of nature and starts thinking that what is present in society is natural 
	- **Aristotle's Reasoning**
		- Necessity of conjunction of people who can't live without each other: eg male and female for the sake of reproduction 
		- This is not artificially created, but natural because the very process of continuation of mankind can not be constructed artificially by humans, but a product of nature.
		- Hence, family is a natural impulse, which is far from solitary.
	 - **Rousseau's Rebuttal**
		 - "Hookups" ie momentary meeting and mating of male and female can also lead to continuation of mankind, female can let go of child when they know how to walk.
	- Aristotle's preemptive rebuttal
		- we wish to propel our offspring into future as they are "versions of ourselves", providing us a sense of belonging (and fascination?) 
#### Master and Slave
- mental capacity is largely defined at birth or primitive stages of life, so does the distinction between the person who can call the shots (the "master"), and the one who can work under given instructions (ie, the "slave")
- since this happens naturally (and in a natural setting this kind of distinction will always exist), inequality is also natural by nature (it is present at the start of the human story)
- The master and slaves complement each other, and derive some utility from one another. Together, along with their families, they form a **household**.
- Households meet needs of daily lives, but not of long term or near/far future.

- Rousseau's disagreement:
	- Aristotle looked around, saw families and thought they are natural. Saw slaves and thought they were natural. Tried to reason why that is natural rather than first thinking what condition likely would have been natural directly
	- He called what he saw, and tried to justify it as natural considering his biases which have developed throughout his life

#### Beyond Households
- Households combine to form villages to take care of "non-daily needs"
- union of several villages leads to a "self-sufficient" community called city.
- Since cities are the end of a chain of collective events, namely family, household, and villages and **"nature is an end"** (because of its completeness)(???)
	- For aristotle, nature itself is purposive, or teleological.
	- ie, in brief it is not a result of random events, but every event happened for a strict defined purpose.
### Teleology

Four ways of explaining natural things:
1. Material Cause
2. Efficient Cause
3. Formal Cause
4. Final Cause

### Man, by nature is political

### *logos*: reason and rationality

### Inequality is natural
