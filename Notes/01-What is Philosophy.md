3. **Characterised by disagreements:**
	- History of philosophy is series of disagreements and disputes, of competing ideas wherein an uncontested winner has never emerged.
	- Opposed to science: science is empirical, but philosophy is largely non-empirical. Even though it is based on experiences and thought experiments, those experiments can't be self replicated and might differ for person to person
	- examples: 
		- Aristotle's theory of Humans being political and Rousseau's theory of humans being solitary beings
		- Mill's idea that moral act is defined by positive consequences on other people's life, v/s Kant's idea that moral act is not dependent on it's consequences but only the principle that guides it
