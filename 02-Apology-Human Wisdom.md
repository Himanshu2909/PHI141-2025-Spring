Socrates talked to three types of people
1. Politicians
	1. Not open to questions
	2. Rarely pause to think
	3. Self Absorbed
2. Poets
	1. Can't explain the meaning of what they are writing
	2. Don't know how they arrive at their philosophy
3. Engineers/Technicians/Craftspersons/Artisans
	1. Overreach

Socrates thinks they are not the wisest because of these flaws.
He thinks he's the wisest because he :
- knows he's not the wisest and lacks understanding
- is not ignorant of the fact that he is not wise. 
- is self aware of his lack of knowledge 

This is called **HUMAN WISDOM**.

knowledge? understanding? wisdom?

Information v/s Knowledge v/s Wisdom

- Facts constitute of information
- Having information and then having the understanding of those principle, and to rationalise that information is knowledge.
- You need to interact with information in order for it to become your knowledge. It is personal in the sense that you use your own thinking to rationalise that knowledge.
- Wisdom is the application of knowledge in a way which beings oneself benefit and is conducted in a righteous manner. It is acting in a way which creates a balance of morality, righteousness and benefit to self.
- Wisdom is about self actualisation

### Human Wisdom

1. Why **HUMAN** Wisdom?
	- Is limited in contrast to Divine Wisdom (What is Divine Wisdom???) which is absolute (What is absolute wisdom???)
	- Is general wisdom as opposed to specialised versions like engineer wisdom, teacher wisdom (these specialised wisdom is possessed by experts) etc
	
2. Humility v/s Complacency
	- Humility: Aware of one's shortcomings
	- Does not promote complacency
	- Complacency is marked by self-satisfaction especially when accompanied by unawareness of actual dangers or deficiencies
	- Humble people are aware of the actual dangers of this deficiency

3. Wisdom
	- You're aware that you lack knowledge
	- When you're aware of the deficiency, and are humble, there is an urge to overcome the lack.
	- You need to put in personal efforts in order to appropriate the information disseminated by sources, and this appropriation and understanding of that information might lead to wisdom
	- Acquiring wisdom is dynamic
	- Wisdom guarantees **real joy** (???)

##### Summary of wisdom

- Divine Wisdom
- Expert's Wisdom
- Human Wisdom
	- Fragmented/Incomplete
	- Awareness of limitations
	- Humility
	- You Care, hence you attempt to gain more wisdom (Not complacent)

##### Socratic Examination
- Going backwards
	- Think about presuppositions
	- Question those presuppotitions
	- Question if the presuppositions leads to the forward argument/impact
- Hence Acknowledge Lack
- Understand that not knowing is problematic

- Unexamined life is not worth living (pg 19 onwards)
	- You should care enough to examine to *some* extent
	- It's about willingness to learn
	- "being in between": we're in a continuous journey of examining yourself
	- Examined Life is Worth Living? NO
